Sure! Below is a simple number guessing program in C. This program will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will have to guess the number. The program will provide hints if the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int number, guess, tries = 0;

    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number = rand() % 100 + 1;

    // Loop until the user guesses the number
    while (1) {
        printf("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ");
        scanf("%d", &guess);
        tries++;

        // Check if the guess is correct
        if (guess == number) {
            printf("Congratulations! You guessed the number in %d tries.
", tries);
            break;
        } else if (guess < number) {
            printf("Too low! Try again.
");
        } else {
            printf("Too high! Try again.
");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Random Number Generation:**
   - `srand(time(NULL))` seeds the random number generator using the current time to ensure different numbers each time.
   - `rand() % 100 + 1` generates a random number between 1 and 100.

2. **User Input and Validation:**
   - The program uses a `while` loop to keep asking for the user's guess until the correct number is guessed.
   - `scanf("%d", &guess)` reads the user's input.
   - The program checks if the guess is equal to the generated number and breaks the loop if it is correct.
   - If the guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint whether the guess is too high or too low.

3. **Output:**
   - The number of tries is displayed once the correct number is guessed.

You can compile and run this program using any C compiler. Make sure to include the necessary headers (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, and `time.h`) and ensure your environment supports these functions.



Sure, here is a list of all prime numbers under 200:

The number 9.8 is bigger than 9.11. When comparing decimal numbers, you start from the leftmost digit and move to the right. In this case:

- Both numbers start with 9.
- The next digit for 9.11 is 1, and for 9.8 it is 8.

Since 8 is greater than 1, 9.8 is the larger number.



To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, we can use a classic proof by contradiction attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Here is the step-by-step proof:

1. **Assume the opposite**: Suppose there are only a finite number of prime numbers. Let's denote these primes by \( p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n \).

2. **Construct a new number**: Consider the number \( N \) defined as:
   \[
   N = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdots p_n + 1
   \]
   This number \( N \) is formed by multiplying all the primes together and then adding 1.

3. **Analyze the new number**: Notice that \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes \( p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n \). To see why, suppose \( p_i \) is one of the primes in the list. Then:
   \[
   N \equiv (p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdots p_n + 1) \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}
   \]
   This means that when \( N \) is divided by any of the primes \( p_i \), the remainder is 1, so \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes in the list.

4. **Prime factorization**: Since \( N \) is a positive integer greater than 1, it must have at least one prime factor. Let's denote this prime factor by \( p \).

5. **Contradiction**: The prime factor \( p \) must be one of the primes in the list \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) because we assumed that these are all the primes. However, we have already established that \( N \) is not divisible by any of these primes. This is a contradiction.

6. **Conclusion**: Since our assumption that there are only a finite number of primes leads to a contradiction, we must conclude that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Therefore, we have proven that there are infinitely many prime numbers.



To determine how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of employees who drive to work:**
   - The company has 200 employees.
   - 60% of the employees drive to work.
   - Number of employees who drive to work = \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \).

2. **Calculate the number of employees who do not drive to work:**
   - Total number of employees = 200.
   - Number of employees who do not drive to work = \( 200 - 120 = 80 \).

3. **Calculate the number of employees who take public transportation:**
   - Half of the employees who do not drive to work take public transportation.
   - Number of employees who take public transportation = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \).

4. **Calculate how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation:**
   - Number of employees who drive to work = 120.
   - Number of employees who take public transportation = 40.
   - Difference = \( 120 - 40 = 80 \).

Thus, the number of employees who drive to work is \(\boxed{80}\) more than the number of employees who take public transportation.



Trade wars can be complex and multifaceted, involving a wide range of economic, political, and strategic factors. Here’s an overview of key points related to tariffs and trade wars, focusing on the knowledge available up to October 2023:

### What are Tariffs?
Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They are a form of protectionism that aims to make foreign goods more expensive compared to domestic products, thereby protecting domestic industries and jobs. Tariffs can be specific (a fixed amount per unit of goods) or ad valorem (a percentage of the goods' value).

### History of Tariffs and Trade Wars
1. **2018 US-China Trade War:**
   - **Background:** Tensions escalated in 2018 when the US initiated a series of tariffs on Chinese goods, citing intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and other unfair trade practices.
   - **US Actions:**
     - The US imposed a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018.
     - In 2019, tariffs were increased to 15% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
     - In 2020, tariffs were increased to 25% on the same $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
   - **Chinese Countermeasures:**
     - China responded with tariffs on $50 billion worth of US goods.
     - In 2019, China increased tariffs on $110 billion worth of US goods.

2. **Subsequent Developments:**
   - **Phase One Agreement (2020):** In January 2020, the US and China signed a phase one trade deal, which included commitments from China to purchase more US goods and services, as well as some tariff reductions.
   - **Continued Tensions:** Despite the phase one agreement, tensions continued, with both sides imposing additional tariffs on each other's goods.

3. **Other Trade Wars:**
   - **US-Canada-Mexico (USMCA) Agreement:** The USMCA replaced NAFTA in 2020, aiming to reduce trade barriers and protect intellectual property.
   - **US-EU Trade Wars:** There have been ongoing discussions and disagreements over issues like steel and aluminum tariffs, digital services taxes, and other trade barriers.

### Effects of Tariffs
1. **Economic Impact:**
   - **Higher Consumer Costs:** Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers.
   - **Reduced Consumer Choice:** Tariffs can limit the variety of products available to consumers.
   - **Impact on Industries:** Tariffs can harm industries that rely on imported components and raw materials, while benefiting protected domestic industries.
   - **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs.

2. **Political and Strategic Impacts:**
   - **National Security Concerns:** Tariffs can be used as a tool to address national security concerns, such as protecting critical infrastructure or ensuring a steady supply of essential goods.
   - **Geopolitical Tensions:** Tariffs can exacerbate geopolitical tensions and create barriers to trade between nations.

3. **Long-term Implications:**
   - **Erosion of Global Trade Networks:** Prolonged trade wars can lead to the erosion of global trade networks and the establishment of parallel supply chains.
   - **Impact on Global Economic Growth:** Trade wars can have a dampening effect on global economic growth by reducing trade and investment.

### Which Side Will Win?
The question of which side "wins" in a trade war is complex and depends on various factors. Some key points to consider:

1. **Economic Strength and Resilience:**
   - **US:** The US economy is large and diverse, with a strong agricultural sector, advanced manufacturing, and a robust services sector. The US has significant financial resources and technological capabilities, which can help it weather trade wars.
   - **China:** China is a major manufacturing hub and has a large domestic market. The country has been investing heavily in technology and innovation, which can provide long-term competitive advantages.

2. **Strategic Objectives:**
   - **US:** The US aims to protect its strategic industries and maintain its global leadership position. It seeks to promote a rules-based international order and reduce geopolitical risks.
   - **China:** China aims to achieve economic and technological self-sufficiency and become a global economic and technological superpower. It seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign technology and create a more resilient economy.

3. **International Reactions:**
   - **Global Trade Networks:** Prolonged trade wars can lead to the fragmentation of global trade networks, which can have long-term negative effects on global economic growth.
   - **Third-party Countries:** Other countries and regions may seek to fill the gaps left by trade wars, potentially leading to a reshaping of global trade dynamics.

### Conclusion
Determining a "winner" in a trade war is challenging, as it depends on a wide range of economic, political, and strategic factors. Both the US and China have taken significant actions, and the outcome will likely depend on how effectively each side can navigate the economic and geopolitical challenges posed by the trade war. Global trade is likely to be permanently altered, with new trade patterns and supply chains emerging.

For the most up-to-date information, it's advisable to follow official statements from government agencies and economic research organizations.

To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, we can use a classic argument attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Here’s a step-by-step proof:

1.
user
Sure, let's go through the proof step by step.
Certainly! Let's go through Euclid's proof step by step:

### Step 1: Assume the Contrary
Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only a finite number of prime numbers. Let's denote these prime numbers as \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), where \( n \) is some positive integer.

### Step 2: Construct a New Number
Consider the number \( N \) defined as:
\[ N = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1 \]
This number \( N \) is constructed by multiplying all the assumed prime numbers together and then adding 1.

### Step 3: Analyze the Divisibility of \( N \)
Now, consider the divisibility of \( N \):
- For any prime \( p_i \) (where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( n \)), \( p_i \) does not divide \( N \). This is because:
  \[ N \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i} \]
  (since \( p_i \) divides the product \( p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n \), but not 1).

### Step 4: Determine the Prime Factors of \( N \)
Since \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), it must have a prime factor. Let's call this prime factor \( q \).

### Step 5: Conclude the Contradiction
- If \( q \) is one of the primes \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), then \( q \) would divide both \( N \) and \( p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n \), which means \( q \) would also divide their difference:
  \[ N - (p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n) = 1 \]
  This is a contradiction because no prime number can divide 1.
- Therefore, \( q \) must be a prime number that is not in the list \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).

### Step 6: Reach a Contradiction
Since we have found a prime number \( q \) that is not in our original list of primes, our assumption that there are only a finite number of primes must be false.

### Conclusion
Thus, there must be an infinite number of prime numbers.

This completes the proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Trade wars are complex and multifaceted phenomena, often involving the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers to achieve various economic and political goals. Here's a detailed overview of tariffs and some insights into the broader context of trade wars, including potential outcomes:

### What are Tariffs?
Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services. They are typically levied by governments to protect domestic industries, generate revenue, or as part of broader trade policies.

### Types of Tariffs
1. **Ad Valorem Tariffs:** These are based on a percentage of the value of the imported goods.
2., **Specific Tariffs:** These are based on a fixed amount per unit of imported goods.
3., **Countervailing Duties:** These are imposed to counteract subsidies provided by foreign governments.
4., **Anti-Dumping Duties:** These are imposed to offset the effect of dumping, which is selling goods at unfairly low prices.

### Impacts of Tariffs
1., **Domestic Industry Protection:** Tariffs can protect domestic industries from foreign competition, allowing them to maintain market share and possibly improve their competitiveness.
2., **Revenue Generation:** Tariffs can also be used as a revenue-raising tool for the government.
3., **Economic Distortion:** Tariffs can distort market prices, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs for consumers.
4., **Trade Retaliation:** Tariffs often lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, escalating the trade war and potentially causing significant economic disruption.

### Historical Examples of Trade Wars
1., **The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930):** This act significantly increased U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. It is often cited as a contributing factor to the Great Depression.
2., **The Transatlantic Trade War (2018-2020):** The U.S., under President Trump, imposed a series of tariffs on imports from China, which led to reciprocal tariffs from China and other trading partners. This led to a significant increase in global trade tensions and economic uncertainty.

### Which Side Will Win?
Determining the winner in a trade war is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including the strength of the respective economies, the resilience of the affected industries, and the effectiveness of the countermeasures.

1., **Economic Resilience:** Countries with more diversified and resilient economies are better positioned to withstand the adverse effects of trade wars.
2., **Industrial Strength:** Domestically strong and competitive industries can mitigate the negative impacts of tariffs.
3., **Political Will:** Strong political will and strategic planning can help navigate trade wars more effectively.
4., **International Relations:** Strong international relations and trade alliances can provide support and mitigate the negative impacts.
5., **Economic Impact on Consumers:** High tariffs often increase consumer prices, which can lead to economic discontent and political pressure to reduce tariffs.

### Potential Outcomes
1., **Mutual Recession:** Both sides may suffer economic downturns, leading to a mutual recession.
2., **Shift in Global Supply Chains:** Companies may shift their supply chains to avoid tariffs, leading to significant changes in global trade patterns.
3., **Economic Resilience:** Countries with more robust economies and industries may emerge stronger in the long term.
4., **Diplomatic Solutions:** Diplomatic negotiations and agreements can resolve trade wars and lead to a more stable international trading environment.

### Conclusion
While it is difficult to predict a clear winner in a trade war, the long-term outcomes are often more favorable for countries with resilient economies and industries. Effective diplomatic strategies and international cooperation are crucial for resolving trade disputes and maintaining a stable global trading environment.

Certainly! Below is a simple number guessing program written in C. This program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask the user to guess it. The program will give hints (higher or lower) until the user guesses the correct number.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int number, guess, tries = 0;

    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(0));

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number = rand() % 100 + 1;

    // Loop until the user guesses the correct number
    while (1) {
        // Ask the user to enter a guess
        printf("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ");
        scanf("%d", &guess);
        tries++;

        // Check if the guess is correct
        if (guess == number) {
            printf("Congratulations! You guessed the number in %d tries.
", tries);
            break;
        } else if (guess < number) {
            printf("Too low! Try again.
");
        } else {
            printf("Too high! Try again.
");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Headers**: The program includes necessary headers like `stdio.h` for input/output, `stdlib.h` for the `rand()` function, and `time.h` for seeding the random number generator.

2. **Seed the Random Number Generator**: `srand(time(0));` seeds the random number generator with the current time to ensure different sequences of random numbers each time the program runs.

3. **Generate a Random Number**: `number = rand() % 100 + 1;` generates a random number between 1 and 100.

4. **Loop for Guessing**: The `while (1)` loop continues until the user guesses the correct number. Inside the loop:
   - The user is prompted to enter a guess.
   - The number of tries is incremented.
   - If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint (too low or too high) and continues the loop.

5. **End the Program**: The program ends after the user correctly guesses the number.

### How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code to a file, for example, `guessing_game.c`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program using `gcc`:
   ```sh
   gcc guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./guessing_game
   ```

This program is a basic example and can be expanded with features like a limit on the number of guesses or a menu for multiple games.

To determine which number is bigger, you can compare the digits from left to right:

1. Both numbers start with 9.
2. The next digit for 9.11 is 1, and for 9.8 is 8.

Since 1 is less than 8, 9.11 is smaller than 9.8.

Therefore, 9.8 is bigger than 9.11.



To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, we can use a classic proof attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Here is the step-by-step proof:

1. **Assume the Contrary**: Suppose there are only a finite number of prime numbers. Let's denote these prime numbers as \( p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n \), where \( p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \ldots < p_n \).

2. **Construct a New Number**: Consider the number \( N \) defined as:
   \[
   N = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1
   \]
   This number \( N \) is constructed by taking the product of all the primes \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), and then adding 1.

3. **Analyze the Divisibility of \( N \)**: We will now show that \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).

   - Suppose \( N \) is divisible by some prime \( p_i \) where \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). Then:
     \[
     N \equiv 0 \pmod{p_i}
     \]
     This means:
     \[
     p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p_i}
     \]
     Rearranging gives:
     \[
     p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n \equiv -1 \pmod{p_i}
     \]
     Since \( p_i \) is one of the primes in the product \( p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n \), it divides \( p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n \). Therefore:
     \[
     p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n \equiv 0 \pmod{p_i}
     \]
     Combining the two congruences, we get:
     \[
     0 \equiv -1 \pmod{p_i}
     \]
     This is a contradiction because 0 is not congruent to -1 modulo any prime number.

4. **Conclusion**: Since \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), \( N \) must either be a prime itself or be divisible by some prime not in the list \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).

5. **Final Step**: Therefore, the assumption that there are only a finite number of primes leads to a contradiction. Hence, there must be an infinite number of prime numbers.

This completes the proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.



To solve the problem, we will break it down into smaller steps.

1. Determine the number of employees who drive to work.
   - The company has 200 employees.
   - 60% of the employees drive to work.
   - Number of employees who drive to work = \( 200 \times 0.60 = 120 \).

2. Determine the number of employees who do not drive to work.
   - Number of employees who do not drive to work = \( 200 - 120 = 80 \).

3. Determine the number of employees who take public transportation.
   - Of the employees who do not drive to work, half take public transportation.
   - Number of employees who take public transportation = \( 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \).

4. Determine how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation.
   - Number of employees who drive to work = 120.
   - Number of employees who take public transportation = 40.
   - Difference = \( 120 - 40 = 80 \).

So, the number of employees who drive to work is \(\boxed{80}\) more than the number of employees who take public transportation.



Trade wars involve countries engaging in economic conflicts by imposing tariffs, quotas, and other restrictions on each other's goods and services. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced trade between countries. Here's an overview of trade wars, focusing on tariffs, and the potential outcomes:

### What are Tariffs?
Tariffs are taxes imposed by a government on imported goods. They are intended to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, make imported goods more expensive, and increase government revenue. Tariffs can be applied to a wide range of goods, from manufactured items to agricultural products.

### History of Trade Wars
Trade wars have a long history, with notable examples including:
- **The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930**: This U.S. law raised tariffs on thousands of imported goods, which is often blamed for exacerbating the Great Depression by reducing international trade.
- **The China-U.S. Trade War (2018-2020)**: This involved a series of tariff hikes by both countries, with the U.S. imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, and China responding with its own tariffs.

### Impact of Tariffs
Tariffs can have significant economic impacts:
1. **Higher Prices for Consumers**: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers.
2. **Reduced Trade**: Tariffs discourage imports, which can reduce the volume of trade between countries.
3. **Job Losses and Job Gains**: In some cases, tariffs can lead to job losses in industries that rely on imported materials or goods. In other cases, they can spur job creation in industries that become more competitive.
4. **Trade Redirected**: Companies may redirect their supply chains to avoid tariffs, which can have complex economic ripple effects.

### Which Side Will Win?
Predicting the winner of a trade war is challenging, as it depends on several factors:
1. **Economic Strength**: The country with a stronger economy may have more resilience to the impacts of a trade war.
2. **Domestic Industries**: The success of domestic industries in adapting to tariffs and finding alternative markets.
3. **Global Supply Chains**: The extent to which supply chains are global and how countries are interconnected.
4. **International Relations**: The level of cooperation or conflict between the countries involved.
5. **Public Opinion and Policy Changes**: Domestic and international political dynamics can shift, leading to changes in policy and public opinion.

### Examples of Outcomes
- **Short-Term Wins**: In some cases, the side that imposes more tariffs may see short-term gains in certain industries or sectors, such as manufacturing or agriculture.
- **Long-Term Losers**: Over the long term, both sides can suffer due to reduced trade, higher prices, and economic instability.

### Conclusion
In trade wars involving tariffs, both sides can be affected, and the outcomes can be complex and multifaceted. The long-term winner is often unclear, as it depends on a variety of factors. Economic resilience, domestic industry strength, and international cooperation are key determinants of who may "win" or at least minimize the negative impacts.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int number,,;
    int guess;
    int attempts = 0;
    
    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));
    
    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number = rand() % 100 + 1;
    
    printf("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
");
    printf("Guess a number between 1 and 100.
");
    
    // Loop until the user guesses the correct number
    do {

To determine which number is bigger between 9.11 and 9.8,:

1. Compare the whole number parts first. Both numbers have the same whole number part,9.
2. Now compare the decimal parts. 

   - The decimal part of 9.11 is 0.11.
   - The decimal part of 9.8 is 0.8.

Since 0.8 (which is 8/10 or 80/100) is greater than 0.11 (which is 11/100), it follows that 9.8 is greater than 9.11.

Therefore,,9.8 is bigger than 9.11.



To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers,—a result known as Euclid's theorem—let's proceed with a proof by contradiction. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

To solve the problem, step by step,:

1. **Determine the number of employees who drive to work:**

   60% of the 200 employees drive to work.
   \[
   0.60 \times 200 = 120 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of employees who don't drive to work:**

   \[
   200 - 120 = 80 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of employees who take public transportation:**

   Half of the employees who don't drive take public transportation.
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ employees}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of employees who drive to work and the number who take public transportation:**

   \[
   \text{Employees who drive to work} = 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Employees who take public transportation} = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of employees who drive to work and those who take public transportation:**

   \[
   120 - 40 = 80
   \]

Thus,, the number of more employees who drive to work than take public transportation is \(\boxed{80}\).

   - The `rand() % 100 + 1` line generates a random number between 1 and 100.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - The program enters a loop where the user can input their guesses.
   - The program checks if the guess is too high or too low, and provides feedback.
   - If the user guesses the correct number, the program congratulates the user and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - `printf` is used to display messages to the user.
   - `scanf` is used to read the user's input.

### Running the Program:
- To compile the program, use the command:

The trade war, refers to the ongoing disputes between the United States and China, over tariffs,,. Here's a detailed overview of the tariffs and the broader context of the trade war:

### Overview of the Trade War

**1. Origins:**
- **2018:** The U.S. initiated a series of tariffs on Chinese imports, as part of a broader strategy to address what it saw as unfair trade practices. The U.S. believed that China was engaging in practices like intellectual property theft, and forced technology transfers.
- **2019:** China retaliated with its own series of tariffs on U.S. imports.
